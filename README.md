# Achiever
## An Achievement addon for modded vmangos server
[My modded vmangos branch is here: https://github.com/tsaah/core/tree/hb-achievements](https://github.com/tsaah/core/tree/hb-achievements)

[![Achiever addon](https://i.postimg.cc/Kz1WLNMy/Achiever-Summary.jpg)](https://i.postimg.cc/Kz1WLNMy/Achiever-Summary.jpg)

## Features:
- gets categories/achievements/criterias from server
- gets character progress from server
- gets achievement earned and criteria update from server
- shows achievements summary, achievements, stats and splash

## TODO and not working addon side:
- stat summary display
- achievement filtering
- achievement tracking
- comparison
- feats of strength
- movable frame
- game tooltip bars
- support for more robust ordering (uiOrder with gaps should not break anything)

## TODO and not working server side:
- vmangos patch filtering on categories and achievements
- comparison events

## TODO and not working database side:
- mask out all non relevant categories/achievements by patch
- update existing categories/achievements/criterias so they become relevant for vanilla
- add new categories/achievements/criterias relevant for vanilla
- write a tool so it will help manage categories/achievements/criterias, validate 'em
